# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This repository was created for breast cancer detection using deep learning. It combines three datasets: INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM, with a total of 24,576 images.

We implemented two approaches:


- Transfer Learning with ResNet
- Custom CNN Model


Multiple experiments were conducted, refining data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, grayscale to RGB conversion, and data augmentation.

After several optimizations, the final model achieved 85% accuracy on the test set.

This repository provides a complete workflow for breast cancer image classification.
