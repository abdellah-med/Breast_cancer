# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning
This repository was created to develop a breast cancer detection model by combining three datasets:
INbreast + MIAS + DDSM, with a total of 24,576 images.

We implemented two different approaches:

Transfer Learning using ResNet
Custom CNN Model
Experiments & Data Preprocessing
Throughout the development, we conducted multiple experiments and preprocessing changes, including:

Image normalization and resizing , 
Handling grayscale vs. RGB input , 
Data augmentation techniques, 
Optimizing batch sizes and learning rates.


After extensive tuning and testing, we achieved a final accuracy of 85% on the test set.

This repository serves as a complete workflow for breast cancer image classification using deep learning.
